        Learning Postman for API Testing
      </h1>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Postman has become one of my favorite tools for testing APIs. It helped
        me debug requests and interact with my backend before I built the
        frontend.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned how to use methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to create,
        retrieve, update, and delete data during development.
