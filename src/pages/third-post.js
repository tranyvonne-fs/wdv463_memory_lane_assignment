      <p>
        When I first learned about REST APIs, it felt like unlocking a superpower
        for web development. REST APIs allow software systems to communicate using
        standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

        In one of our Full Sail projects, we connected a React frontend to a Node.js
        backend with MongoDB using a REST API. Understanding how requests and responses
        worked helped me build full-stack apps more confidently.
