TailwindCSS changed the way I think about styling websites.

Instead of switching between CSS files and HTML, I write utility classes right in my JSX. This makes development faster and more visual.

For this blog, I used Tailwind to quickly create:
- A responsive layout
- Clean typography
- Consistent spacing and padding

Hereâ€™s an example of a button class I used:

```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded hover:bg-blue-600">
  Click me
</button>
