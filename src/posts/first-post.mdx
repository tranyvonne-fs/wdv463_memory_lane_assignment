Postman has become one of my favorite tools for testing APIs.

When I was working on a project that involved CRUD operations using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, Postman helped me simulate requests and debug responses. It allowed me to interact with my API without needing to build a frontend first.

Here‚Äôs how I used Postman during development:

### üîç Testing Endpoints
I used **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, and **DELETE** methods to:
- Create new records
- Fetch all or individual records
- Update data
- Delete entries

Each request was customizable. I could pass in headers, query parameters, and a JSON body with just a few clicks.

### ‚úÖ Writing Tests
Postman also lets you write JavaScript-based test scripts. I created basic tests like:
```javascript
pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
  pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});
