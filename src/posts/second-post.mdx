When I first learned about REST APIs, it felt like unlocking a superpower for web development.

APIs allow different software systems to communicate. A REST API uses HTTP methods like **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, and **DELETE** to manage data.

In our Full Sail project, we used a REST API to connect the frontend React app to a backend Node.js server with MongoDB. Learning to test endpoints using Postman was a game-changer and really helped me understand how requests and responses work.

If you're new to APIs, I recommend:
- Exploring [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
- Reading the [MDN Web Docs on Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
- Building your own mini API with Express.js
